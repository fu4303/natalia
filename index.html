        Corporate rapper? Tech whisperer? First & foremost, I am a writer born
        in UCLA’s English Department, forged on the ground as a journalist &
        fine-tuned through years in communications. Depending on the day, I’m
        also a brand storyteller, ad campaign developer, voiceover script
        creator, marketing teammate or digital content writer. Usually, you’ll
        find me working with digital pioneers & innovators to translate complex
